* Shortcut to share the backup with that saves it then runs bear.py?
* Note concatenater: turn a list of links into a new note with those contents. Maybe each link is a heading in the new note.
* Reference utility
  * Parse references sections to find refs that are present in many notes but have no lit note or have a lit note but aren't linked to it
  *  Fix DOI links
* Global options specified in Bear note; then we can exclude backlinks from link finder and collector, and not include options note in backlinks
* Handle \s in titles: Bear auto completes titles in links with an escaped backslash: 'AND\/OR'
* Extract summaries marked in some way when collecting, or otherwise
* Look for "[[literature note ðŸ“”]] ->" and insert summary
* Also offer action to summarize all literature notes in a given note or tag
* Share note id to search; option to make links at top to jump to sections with highlighted results
* Some kind of state storage, eg for clearing search results on second sharing
* Increase or decrease heading levels; need interactive ui
* Find isolated DOIs on page and replace with references
* Move tags at the bottom to the top
* Collect multiple tags
* Option to remove all highlighting
* Search and replace, including quick common actions defined in options.ini. Possible to do interactive with highlighting? Not without special purpose UI.
* Floating keyboard helper: mark sections of bullets to indent or dedent
* TOC: add Top links to each section if length of doc exceeds some amount
