## Introduction
This is `bearutils`, a collection of [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) scripts for working with Bear on iOS. It was  inspired by the desire to make backlinks possible in combination with slow process of getting notes from Bear via the `x-callback-url` mechanism (the method used by other iOS Bear backlink generators), and quickly evolved into a framework for doing a variety of tasks with Bear, including:

* Adding backlinks
* Adding tables of contents
* Highlighting search terms
* Collecting links to notes with a given tag into a single note
* Appending or prepending text to note titles based on a tag
* Moving tags from the end of a note to the beginning

## How it works/what it does
`bearutils` processes all or a subset of Bear notes. It loads the requested set of notes and runs a series of _processors_ on them which accomplish various tasks, such as those described above.

`bearutils` works via a method similar to Andy Matuschak's [note-link-janitor](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor), which reads Bear's SQL database to make backlinks. Because there's no access to the filesystem in iOS, `bearutils` instead operates on a backup file exported from Bear. This method is very fast, and has the extra advantage of ensuring you have a current backup should something go horribly wrong when running the program! `bearutils` extracts the notes from a Bear backup file and then performs actions.

For maximum safety, `bearutils` uses the Bear API to make any changes to notes. This could potentially change in a future release, but would the require manually importing a modified backup file.

Although `bearutils`  gains its speed by reading a backup rather than using Bear's API to read each note individually, there is one circumstance where it must fetch a note from Bear rather than using the backup. This is when the note has an attachment such as an image. In this case, the backed-up note doesn't contain the information needed to reference the attachment when saving the modified note to Bear, so `bearutils` must request the note via the API to get this information. It only does so, however, when a processor makes changes to a note.

Note that currently `bearutils` works only with the default Bear markdown style, not with actual Markdown.

## Installing
First, you need Pythonista ([app store link](https://apps.apple.com/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097)). Yes, it costs money. It's with it.

Next, you need `bearutils`. The easiest method is to download the [zip file](https://github.com/anjiro/bearutils/archive/main.zip), expand it with the Files app, then share the folder with Pythonista ("External Files -> Open").

## Configuring & running
`bearutils` can work with all of the notes saved in Bear, or with a manually selected subset. Either way, you need to run `bear.py`. Do so by selecting it, then hitting the play button in the editor (you may need to hold down on the play button to force running in Python 3).

Global  options for `bearutils` and the processors can be found in `options.ini`. Some processors can be configured via a special note titled "Beatitudes actions", which applies when working with all notes. When working with just one or a few notes, `bearutils` presents an options dialog.

### Processing a few notes
If you just want to add a table of contents to a note or two, it might be irritating to have to export a backup. Instead, you can copy the note IDs from the notes you want `bearutils` to process. When launched, `bearutils` will detect the IDs on the clipboard and prompt you to use them or a Bear backup.

The downside of processing notes in this way is that `bearutils` must get each note via the Bear API, so it's really only practical for one or two notes.

### Processing all notes
Before launching `bearutils`, export a backup from Bear (Settings -> Import & export -> Backup all notes) and save it with the Files app. When you launch `bearutils`, pick "Select a Bear backup file" if prompted, and select your just-saved backup. `bearutils` will then run the actions configured in `options.ini` and the "Bearutils actions" note (see below).

## Processors
`bearutils` features a number of built-in note processors. Some need to look at all of the notes (e.g., the backlink generator) and some can work on single notes (e.g., the table of contents generator).

### Backlinker
The main reason for the existence of `bearutils` is to generate backlinks, so this is one of the actions. The backlink processor adds a Backlinks section to any note linked to by another.

### Table of contents generator
This processor will search notes for a  `## Table of contents`  heading and will update it with a list of links to headings within the note. It will also look for a `## TOC` header as a shorthand placeholder.

### Note actions
Create a note with the title `Bearutils actions` (title configurable in `options.ini`).  Make a bulleted list. Each bullet represents an action to take when `bearutils` processes all notes.

Available actions include the following. Any time a tag is used, you can surround it with backticks to prevent the Bearutils note from being tagged with that tag.

### Add or remove text in titles
I like to use emoji to represent certain types of notes. You can do the following (actual examples):

* Append to titles in `#some tag/subtag#`: üëç
* Prepend to titles in `#stuff`: Hello
* Remove from titles in `#things`: üòÇ

Note that the last action, Remove, only removes from the beginning and end of titles.

### Highlight searches
Bear on iOS doesn't show search results within notes. `bearutils` will search your notes and highlight search term terms. You can do the following to search:

* ::search term:: in everywhere
* ::search term:: in `#tag`
* ::search term:: in [[Some note]]

You can later remove highlights by crossing them out;

* -::Found search term::- in everywhere
* -::Horses::- in [[Temp]]

### Collecting note links
It can be useful to collect links to all notes with a given tag, for example in using the [Zettelkasten method](zettelkasten.de).  The Collect action will find all notes with a given tag and add them to the specified note, but only if they aren't already linked in that note:

* Collect `#topics/metamaterials#` in [[¬ß Metamaterials]]

## Configuring `bearutils`
The file `options.ini` controls how `bearutils` works. It uses Python's [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/configparser.html) module. The `[Processors]` section defines what to do when either a few notes are to be processed (i.e., from copied note IDs) or when all notes are processed from a backup. The other sections are options for each processor.

The options file is commented and should be reasonably self-explanatory.

## Extending Bearutils
`bearutils` is designed to be modular and easy to extend by writing new processors. Processors should subclass `processors.notes_processor` and are required to implement two methods: `process ()` and `render ()`.

The first method, `process ()`, determines which of the passed notes will be changed, while `render()` returns those changes. The reason for this structure is that the Bear backup file does not include the UUID for attachments to a note (e.g., images), so `bearutils` has to fetch the note directly from Bear using the API to be able to preserve attachments when it saves changes.

See `notes_processor.py` and the processors in `processors/` for more details.

## Disclaimer
`bearutils` is a personal project, written entirely on an iPad with my thumb while a baby slept in my lap, and will probably delete all of your notes, corrupt your hard drive, steal your dog, and eat the last cookie.
